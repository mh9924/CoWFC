# How to Build
First, you will need to be running on Ubuntu. Otherwise the [setup script](https://github.com/kyle95wm/cowfc_installer) will not run. Please run the following command below to get started:

`mkdir /var/www ; cd /var/www && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyle95wm/cowfc_installer/master/cowfc.sh && chmod +x cowfc.sh && ./cowfc.sh`

If you're on AWS, you can run this instead:

`mkdir /var/www ; cd /var/www && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyle95wm/cowfc_installer/master/cowfc.sh && chmod +x cowfc.sh && && touch /var/www/.aws_install && ./cowfc.sh`

Your server will reboot after adding the PHP7.1 repo. After the server has rebooted, please issue the following commands:
`cd /var/www/ && ./cowfc.sh`

Follow the rest of the on-screen instructions and let your server build.

# TODO
- Fix Profile Unban function - button does nothing
- Integrate moderator rank system
- Integrate moderator account management portal
  - Only accessible by highest ranked moderators
  - Modification of users of the same rank must be done through shell
- More ideas I'm sure we haven't thought of yet :p
